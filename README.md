# SuperFizzBuzz

## Background: Classic FizzBuzz

Classic fizzbuzz output is typically described as “Write a program that prints the numbers
from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number. For multiples of 5,
print “Buzz”. For Multiples of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”. 

Typical fizzbuzz output looks like:

1

2

Fizz

4

Buzz
...
88

89

FizzBuzz

91

...


## Requirements: Super FizzBuzz

1. Develop a class library called SuperFizzBuzz that can do the following:

* Can produce fizzbuzz output for a user-supplied range of numbers – e.g., from 2
to 35, or from 1 to 1,000,000,000, or from -1 to -35, etc.

* Can produce output for a user supplied set of integers, even if they’re not
sequential.

* Can generate tokens other than “Fizz” and “Buzz” and can evaluate division by
numbers other than 3 and 5. Maybe a user wants to test division by 4, 13, and 9,
and output “Frog”, “Duck,” and “Chicken” for them (e.g., in this case, 52 would
ouput “FrogDuck”, 36 would output “FrogChicken”, 468 would output
“FrogDuckChicken”, etc.)

2. Write a console application, using your SuperFizzBuzz class, to solve the classic
FizzBuzz problem as described above in “The Basics”.

3. Write a second console application demonstrating advanced usage of SuperFizzBuzz
that performs the following:

* Print the numbers from -12 through 145.

* For multiples of 3, print “Fizz”

* For Multiples of 7, print “Buzz”

* For Multiples of 38, print “Bazz”

* Print the appropriate combination of tokens for any number that matches
more than one of those rules
